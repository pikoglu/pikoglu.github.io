## Who am I?

I'm **Felix Fourreau**. I completed the **MVA Master (Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage)** at **ENS Paris-Saclay** and the engineering program at **École des Ponts ParisTech** in **June 2025**.

From **June to October 2025**, I am a **Research Intern at SnT, University of Luxembourg** (supervisor: [Maxime Cordy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sRXHjkIAAAAJ&hl=fr)), working on **machine learning for optimal power-flow (OPF) prediction** in power grids, with a submission to NeurIPS 2025: [Constraint-Guided Prediction Refinement via Deterministic Diffusion Trajectories (CARDIFF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12911).

Previously:
- **CERMICS (ENPC), Paris — Jun–Sep 2024**: Implemented an efficient **belief-propagation image inpainting** algorithm in **C++**, supervised by [Pascal Monasse](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dZRK3HsAAAAJ&hl=fr).
- **CEA, Paris — Jan–Jun 2024**: Studied **graph neural network instability for Hamiltonian dynamics**, supervised by [Mihai-Cosmin Marinica](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yfj9RqUAAAAJ&hl=en).

My interests: **generative modeling (diffusion / flow matching)**, **constraint-satisfying & physics-informed ML**, **computer vision**, and more broadly **quantitative modeling and optimization under uncertainty**.

## Open to Opportunities

I am seeking a **full-time position starting January 2026**.  
I’m interested in roles where **rigorous mathematics, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making** meet real-world problems (research labs, tech, energy, quantitative modeling, etc.). A **PhD** remains an option if the project aligns with these themes.

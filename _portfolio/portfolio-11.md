* __With__: [Amaury Bacot](https://github.com/Momo9002/), supervised by [Pascal Monasse](https://ecoledesponts.fr/pascal-monasse)  
* __Resources__: [Imagine++](https://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/) — developed by the [LIGM](https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/), [Code](https://github.com/Momo9002/doodle_jump)
* __When__: 2023

This project involved recreating the classic *DoodleJump* game entirely from scratch in C++, using only the [Imagine++](https://imagine.enpc.fr/imagine/index.html) graphics library — a little-known, research-focused C++ library developed by the [LIGM](https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/)

One of the main challenges was the steep learning curve of Imagine++, due to its niche usage. We had to dive deep into the library’s structure and functionalities to build a fully-featured game capable of running a smooth and responsive version of *DoodleJump*.

The game replicates all core mechanics of the original:  
– random and breakable platforms  
– vertical camera tracking  
– monsters and collision handling  
– gravity, jump physics, and power-ups  

Thanks to the performance of C++, the final game runs efficiently and handles real-time gameplay with complex interactions.
